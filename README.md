# AI-Powered Disease Prediction System

## Project Overview

This project aims to build an advanced AI system for predicting diseases based on comprehensive health data. 
The system will integrate data from disparate sources, including sensors, imagery, health history, and other relevant datasets, to provide predictive insights into potential health issues.

The application will be developed using a microservice architecture.
